## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## My name is Guilherme Parisi, I'm Brazilian. You can call me Gee (with a hard G as in Go).
## No I don't play football/soccer well, but yeah, I can dance. Not so much Samba, but definitely ForrÃ³, ever heard of it?

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as an English teacher (as a second language). I'm studying programming to switch work, however.
- ðŸ’» I'm looking to become an international programmer (I want to work for an American or European company). Not so sure about my area of expertise yet. Got any suggestions?
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming in Alura, an online Brazilian school.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about free English as a second language learning tips... or even Portuguese, Italian or Spanish for that matter.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I really like working in teams, helping people out and learning new stuff.
